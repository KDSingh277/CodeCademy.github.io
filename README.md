The progress I am making through the online course will be recorded in this repository.

#CLOCK PROJECT
- uses Date object to get hours, minutes seconds
- worked on the UI to make it an Analog clock instead of digital.

#FlexBox Project
- uses flexbox to style the css
- I had recently learnt that and wanted to implement it
- I like Grid better

#Desmotos Art Project
- very basic HTML and CSS for a home page
